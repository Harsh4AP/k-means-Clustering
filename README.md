# k-means-Clustering

# 🔍 K-Means Clustering Analysis on Electric Vehicle Specifications


## 🚀 Objective
- Preprocess and scale the dataset
- Use the *Elbow Method* to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Apply *K-Means Clustering* to group similar vehicles
- Perform *PCA* (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction
- Visualize the clustered data in 2D

---

 ## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Steps Involved

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Selected only numeric features for clustering
- Handled missing values

### 2. Feature Scaling
Used StandardScaler to normalize the dataset before clustering.

### 3. Elbow Method
Identified the optimal number of clusters by plotting *Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)*.

### 4. K-Means Clustering
Applied K-Means to group vehicles based on similar features.

### 5. PCA Visualization
Used PCA to reduce dimensions and plotted clusters in 2D space for interpretability.
